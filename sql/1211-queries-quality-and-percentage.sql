-- Question:
-- We define query quality as:
--
--     The average of the ratio between query rating and its position.
--
-- We also define poor query percentage as:
--
--     The percentage of all queries with rating less than 3.
--
-- Write a solution to find each query_name, the quality and poor_query_percentage.
--
-- Both quality and poor_query_percentage should be rounded to 2 decimal places.
--
-- Return the result table in any order.

-- Approach:
-- Just follow the question, and do what the question is asking

SELECT  query_name,
        ROUND(AVG(rating*1.0/position), 2) AS quality, -- or ROUND(SUM(rating*1.0 / position) / COUNT(query_name), 2) AS quality
        ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN rating < 3 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)*100.0 / COUNT(query_name), 2) AS poor_query_percentage
FROM Queries
GROUP BY query_name
